# Chapter 2 - Looping
An introduction to looping constructs, providing the skills needed to handle repetitive tasks efficiently.

## ðŸ“– Chapter Overview
In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn about loops, which are essential for executing code repeatedly. Mastery of these looping structures will set the groundwork for tackling complex data structures and algorithms. Topics covered include:

- While Loops
- Do-While Loops
- For Loops
- Break and Continue Statements
- Pattern Problems Using Loops

Assignments and practice sets in this chapter will help you understand the nuances of each looping structure and their practical applications in solving coding problems.
