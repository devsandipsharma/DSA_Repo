# DSA Repo

**A curated collection of assignments and practice questions to master Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript.**

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the **DSA Repo**, a structured learning path to help you build strong foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with JavaScript. Each chapter provides:
- **Assignments**: Core questions targeting essential DSA concepts.
- **Practice Sets**: Additional problems for skill reinforcement and mastery.

Each question file includes:
- The problem statement.
- A JavaScript solution with a step-by-step explanation.
- Links to resources and tutorials for necessary background knowledge.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, each containing dedicated folders for assignments and practice questions:
